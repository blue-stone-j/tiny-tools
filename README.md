### deduplication
In some cases, we may store some same files or similiar pictures. This folder contains tools to help you deal with them.

### qr_code
According to your domain/site, generate QR code. You can also generate code for something else.

### bookmarks counter
When there are too many bookmarks, how to count bookmarks? Export bookmarks from chrome, replace `bookmarks.html` with your bookmarks file and run `python3 bookmarks_counter.py`. And then you will know it.
